# Iris-Flower-Prediction-ML-Project

## Overview
This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its petal and sepal measurements. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of a classic classification problem.

## Data
The project uses the popular Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Machine Learning Model
We implement a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, ydata_profiling. The model is trained on the dataset to make accurate predictions.

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter Notebook with the ML model implementation and training process.
- Python script for making predictions.
- Requirements file to install necessary libraries.
- Sample Iris flower data for testing the model.

## How to Use
You can use the model to make predictions by running the provided Python script or by referring to the Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step guide.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- ydata_profiling
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or use the Python script to make predictions.
